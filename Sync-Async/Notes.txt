The fs module in Node.js provides methods for interacting with the file system, and it supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations.

Key Differences
Synchronous Methods:

1..Block the execution of subsequent code until the current file system operation is complete.
2..Useful for small tasks or scripts where blocking behavior is acceptable.
3..Methods are suffixed with Sync (e.g., readFileSync, writeFileSync).

Asynchronous Methods:

1..Do not block the event loop.
2..Execute the operation in the background and invoke a callback or return a Promise when complete.
3..Methods are not suffixed with Sync.
